# Technical Memorandum: Character Behavioral Modeling Using Large Language Models

## 1. Problem Formulation

### 1.1 Core Challenge
Character behavior modeling represents an ambitious extension of language model capabilities into the domain of behavioral prediction. Our goal is to create a system that can understand and replicate the behavior patterns of literary characters, beginning with Anne Shirley from "Anne of Green Gables" as our initial test case. This challenge requires us to move beyond simple language patterns to model the intricate web of personality traits, emotional responses, and behavioral consistencies that make a character feel authentic.

### 1.2 Theoretical Foundation
The project builds on the fundamental hypothesis that human behavior can be modeled as a sequence prediction problem, similar to language modeling. Recent research supports this direction:

- Nguyen et al. (2024): Demonstrated LLMs' ability to predict human behavior in sequential decision-making tasks
- Xie et al. (2022): Introduced COMMA framework modeling relationships among motivations, emotions, and actions
- Jiang et al. (2024): Developed Reinforcement Learning with Human Behavior (RLHB) framework
- Binz and Schulz (2023): Showed human-like intuitive behavior and reasoning biases in LLMs

### 1.3 Innovation: Scene-Based Processing
Rather than processing continuous behavior streams, we break behavior down into discrete scenes, similar to theatrical or cinematic structure. Each scene contains multiple dimensions of information:

- Physical setting and timing
- Character states and relationships
- Actions and dialogue
- Emotional context and motivations

This approach makes the complex task of behavior modeling more manageable while preserving important context.
