Character Behavioral Modeling Using Large Language Models

This is the repository for the Character Behavioral Model based on LLM, which is a project aimed to to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in modeling and replicating complex character behaviors. The project aims to investigate whether modern language models can capture and reproduce not just linguistic patterns but deeper behavioral and personality traits.
